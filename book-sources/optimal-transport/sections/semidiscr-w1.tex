\section{Semi-discrete and $W_1$}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Semi-discrete}

- semi-discrete
  prove differentiability and grad formula when beta has density 
- stochastic optimization, 
- optimal quantization, 
   solution in 1D via quantile function
   kmeans

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$W_1$}

- W1
  c-transform f->-f
  Dual lipschitz function
  Div constraint
  on graphs 
- Dual norms, RKHS norms, metrizing weak* condition
- phi-divergence, definition, dual
- GANS, neural networks intro (discr, generative) WGANS
