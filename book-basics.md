> Gabriel Peyr√©, [An Introduction to Imaging Sciences](book-basics-sources/IntroImaging.pdf).

The [Latex sources of this text are available](https://github.com/mathematical-tours/mathematical-tours.github.io/tree/master/book-basics-sources).

The three chapters of this text are independent and present introductions to a few important mathematical foundation of imaging sciences:

- Chapter 1 presents Shannon theory of compression, and insists in particular on the entropy bound for coding of information.
- Chapter 2 presents the basics of image processing, in particular some important processing (quantization, densoising, colors).
- Chapter 3 presents sampling theory, from Shannon classical sampling to compressed sensing. It also serves as a gentle introduction to the field of inverse problem regularization.

The exposition level for the two chapter is elementary. The last chapter presents more advanced mathematical concepts and results.
